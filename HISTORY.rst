v0.8.0 (14 February 2025)
-------------------------

This minor release introduces a new feature for temporal averaging with custom seasons
spanning the calendar year. It also includes the ability to detect and drop incomplete
seasons using the ``drop_incomplete_season`` config, which will eventually replace
``drop_incomplete_djf`` (previously limited to DJF seasons). Additionally, a bug in the
``regrid2`` regridder has been fixed, ensuring coordinates are now preserved correctly.

compatibility with NumPy 2.0 (which introduces breaking changes). It also fixes a bug
in the ``get_bounds()`` method where bounds could not be found on supported non-CF axes
(e.g., "latitude", "longitude", etc.) even with the ``"bounds"`` attribute set on the
axes.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/compare/v0.6.1...v0.7.0

v0.6.1 (29 November 2023)
-------------------------

This patch version adds a default value to the ``axes`` argument in
``ds.bounds.add_missing_bounds()`` (``axes=["X", "Y", "T"]``). The ``axes``
argument was added in v0.6.0 and did not have a default value, which
inadvertently introduced a breaking change to the API.

``xesmf`` is now a required dependency because its core library, ESMF,
supports Windows as of Feb/2023. More information can be found
`here <https://github.com/conda-forge/esmf-feedstock/pull/65>`_.

v0.5.0 (27 March 2023)
--------------------------

This long-awaited minor release includes feature updates to support an
optional user-specified climatology reference period when calculating
climatologies and departures, support for opening datasets using the
``directory`` key of the legacy CDAT `Climate Data Markup Language
(CDML) <https://cdms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/cdms_6.html>`__
format (an XML dialect), and improved support for using custom time
coordinates in temporal APIs.

This release also includes a bug fix for singleton coordinates breaking
the ``swap_lon_axis()`` function. Additionally, Jupyter Notebooks for
presentations and demos have been added to the documentation.

Features
~~~~~~~~

-  Update departures and climatology APIs with reference period by

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0

v0.4.0 (9 November 2022)
--------------------------

This minor release includes a feature update to support datasets that
have *N* dimensions mapped to *N* coordinates to represent an axis. This
means ``xcdat`` APIs are able to intelligently select which axis's
coordinates and bounds to work with if multiple are present within the
dataset. Decoding time is now a lazy operation, leading to significant
upfront runtime improvements when opening datasets with
``decode_times=True``.

A new notebook called “A Gentle Introduction to xCDAT” was added to the
documentation gallery to help guide new xarray/xcdat users. xCDAT is now
hosted on Zenodo with a DOI for citations.

There are various bug fixes for bounds, naming of spatial weights, and a
missing flag for ``xesmf`` that broke curvilinear regridding.

Features
~~~~~~~~

-  Support for N axis dimensions mapped to N coordinates by
   `Tom Vo`_ and `Stephen Po-Chedley`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/343

   -  Rename ``get_axis_coord()`` to ``get_dim_coords()`` and
      ``get_axis_dim()`` to ``get_dim_keys()``
   -  Update spatial and temporal accessor class methods to refer to the
      dimension coordinate variable on the data_var being operated on,
      rather than the parent dataset

-  Decoding times (``decode_time()``) is now a lazy operation, which
   results in significant runtime improvements by `Tom Vo`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/343

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  Fix ``add_bounds()`` not ignoring 0-dim singleton coords by
   `Tom Vo`_ and `Stephen Po-Chedley`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/343
-  Fix name of spatial weights with singleton coord by `Tom Vo`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/379
-  Fixes ``xesmf`` flag that was missing which broke curvilinear
   regridding by `Jason Boutte`_ and `Stephen Po-Chedley`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/374

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Add FAQs section for temporal metadata by `Tom Vo`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/383
-  Add gentle introduction notebook by `Tom Vo`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/373
-  Link repo to Zenodo and upload GitHub releases by `Tom Vo`_ in

   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/370
-  Automate release notes generation by `Tom Vo`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/368

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/compare/v0.3.3...v0.4.0

v0.3.3 (12 October 2022)
------------------------

This patch release fixes a bug where calculating daily climatologies/departures for
specific CF calendar types that have leap days breaks when using ``cftime``. It also
includes documentation updates.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  Drop leap days based on CF calendar type to calculate daily
   climatologies and departures by `Tom Vo`_ and `Jiwoo Lee`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/350

   -  Affected CF calendar types include ``gregorian``, ``proleptic_gregorian``, and
      ``standard``
   -  Since a solution implementation for handling leap days is
      generally opinionated, we decided to go with the route of least
      complexity and overhead (drop the leap days before performing
      calculations). We may revisit adding more options for the user to determine how
      they want to handle leap days (based on how valuable/desired it is).

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Add horizontal regridding gallery notebook by `Jason Boutte`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/328
-  Add doc for staying up to date with releases by `Tom Vo`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/355

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/compare/v0.3.2...v0.3.3

v0.3.2 (16 September 2022)
--------------------------

This patch release focuses on bug fixes related to temporal averaging,
spatial averaging, and regridding. ``xesmf`` is now an optional
dependency because it is not supported on ``osx-arm64`` and ``windows``
at this time. There is a new documentation page for HPC/Jupyter
guidance.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Temporal Average
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix multiple temporal avg calls on same dataset breaking by
   `Tom Vo`_ in https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/329
-  Fix incorrect results for group averaging with missing data by
   `Stephen Po-Chedley`_ in https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/320

Spatial Average
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix spatial bugs: handle datasets with domain bounds out of order and
   zonal averaging by `Stephen Po-Chedley`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/340

Horizontal Regridding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Fix regridder storing NaNs for bounds by `Stephen Po-Chedley`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/344

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Update README and add HPC/Jupyter Guidance by `Stephen Po-Chedley`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/331

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Make ``xesmf`` an optional dependency by `Paul Durack`_ in
   https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/pull/334

   -  This is required because ``xesmf`` (and ``esmpy`` which is a
      dependency) are not supported on ``osx-arm64`` and ``windows`` at
      this time.
   -  Once these platforms are supported, ``xesmf`` can become a direct
      dependency of ``xcdat``.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0

v0.1.0 (7 October 2021)
------------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Add geospatial averaging API through
   ``DatasetSpatialAverageAccessor`` class by `Stephen Po-Chedley`_ and
   `Tom Vo`_ in #87

   -  Does not support parallelism with Dask yet

-  Add wrappers for xarray's ``open_dataset`` and ``open_mfdataset`` to
   apply common operations such as:

   -  If the dataset has a time dimension, decode both CF and non-CF
      time units
   -  Generate bounds for supported coordinates if they don’t exist
   -  Option to limit the Dataset to a single regular (non-bounds) data
      variable while retaining any bounds data variables

-  Add ``DatasetBoundsAccessor`` class for filling missing bounds,
   returning mapping of bounds, returning names of bounds keys
-  Add ``BoundsAccessor`` class for accessing xcdat public methods
   from other accessor classes

   -  This will be probably be the API endpoint for most users, unless
      they prefer importing the individual accessor classes

-  Add ability to infer data variables in xcdat APIs based on the
   "xcdat_infer" Dataset attr

   -  This attr is set in ``xcdat.open_dataset()``,
      ``xcdat_mfdataset()``, or manually

-  Utilizes ``cf_xarray`` package
   (https://github.com/xarray-contrib/cf-xarray)
