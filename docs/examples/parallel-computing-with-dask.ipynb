    "- **Use NumPy**\n",
    "  - If your data fits comfortably in RAM and you are not performance bound, then using NumPy might be the right choice.\n",
    "  - Dask adds another layer of complexity which may get in the way.\n",
    "  - If you are just looking for speedups rather than scalability then you may want to consider a project like [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)\n",
    "- **Select a good chunk size**\n",
    "  - A common performance problem among Dask Array users is that they have chosen a chunk size that is either too small (leading to lots of overhead) or poorly aligned with their data (leading to inefficient reading).\n",
    "- Orient your chunks\n",
    "  - When reading data you should align your chunks with your storage format.\n",
    "- **Avoid Oversubscribing Threads**\n",
    "  - By default Dask will run as many concurrent tasks as you have logical cores. It assumes that each task will consume about one core. However, many array-computing libraries are themselves multi-threaded, which can cause contention and low performance.\n",
    "- **Consider Xarray**\n",
    "  - The Xarray package wraps around Dask Array, and so offers the same scalability, but also adds convenience when dealing with complex datasets\n",
    "- **Build your own Operations**\n",
    "  - Often we want to perform computations for which there is no exact function in Dask Array. In these cases we may be able to use some of the more generic functions to build our own.\n",

    "> All of the large-scale Dask collections like Dask Array, Dask DataFrame, and Dask Bag and the fine-grained APIs like delayed and futures generate task graphs where each node in the graph is a normal Python function and edges between nodes are normal Python objects that are created by one task as outputs and used as inputs in another task. After Dask generates these task graphs, it needs to execute them on parallel hardware. This is the job of a task scheduler. Different task schedulers exist, and each will consume a task graph and compute the same result, but with different performance characteristics.\n",
    "> Dask has two families of task schedulers:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1.  **Single-machine scheduler**: This scheduler provides basic features on a local process or thread pool. This scheduler was made first and is the default. It is simple and cheap to use, although it can only be used on a single machine and does not scale\n",
    "> 2.  **Distributed scheduler**: This scheduler is more sophisticated, offers more features, but also requires a bit more effort to set up. It can run locally or distributed across a cluster\n",
