    "\n",
    "- [Use NumPy](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/array-best-practices.html#use-numpy)\n",
    "  - If your **data fits comfortably in RAM and you are not performance bound**, then using **NumPy might be the right choice**. Dask adds another layer of complexity which may get in the way.\n",
    "  - If you are just looking for **speedups rather than scalability** then you may want to **consider a project like [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)**\n",
    "- [Select a good chunk size](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/array-best-practices.html#select-a-good-chunk-size)\n",
    "  - A **common performance problem among Dask Array users** is that they have chosen a **chunk size** that is either **too small** (leading to lots of overhead) or **poorly aligned with their data** (leading to inefficient reading).\n",
    "- [Orient your chunks](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/array-best-practices.html#orient-your-chunks)\n",
    "  - When reading data you should **align your chunks with your storage format**.\n",
    "- [Avoid Oversubscribing Threads](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/array-best-practices.html#avoid-oversubscribing-threads)\n",
    "  - **By default Dask will run as many concurrent tasks as you have logical cores.** It assumes that **each task** will consume about **one core**. However, many array-computing libraries are themselves multi-threaded, which can cause contention and low performance.\n",
    "- [Consider Xarray](hhttps://docs.dask.org/en/stable/array-best-practices.html#consider-xarray)\n",
    "  - The **Xarray package wraps** around **Dask Array**, and so offers the **same scalability**, but also adds **convenience when dealing with complex datasets**.\n",
    "- [Build your own Operations](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/array-best-practices.html#build-your-own-operations)\n",
    "  - Often we want to perform computations for which there is no exact function in Dask Array. In these cases we may be able to use some of the more generic functions to build our own.\n",
