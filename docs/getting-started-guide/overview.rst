xCDAT: Xarray Climate Data Analysis Tools
=========================================

xCDAT is an extension of `xarray`_ for climate data analysis on structured grids. It
serves as a modern successor to the Community Data Analysis Tools (`CDAT`_) library.

Project Motivation
------------------

The goal of xCDAT is to provide generalizable features and utilities for simple and
robust analysis of climate data. xCDATâ€™s scope focuses on routine climate research
analysis operations such as loading, averaging, and regridding data on structured grids
(e.g., rectilinear, curvilinear). Some key xCDAT features are inspired by or ported from
the core CDAT library, while others leverage powerful libraries in the xarray ecosystem
(e.g., `xESMF`_, `xgcm`_) to deliver robust APIs. xCDAT has the ability to operate
generally across model and observational datasets that follow the `CF Metadata Convention`_
by interpreting CF Metadata through the `cf_xarray`_ package.

The xCDAT core team's mission is to provide a maintainable and extensible package
that serves the needs of the climate community in the long-term. We are excited
to be working on this project and hope to have you onboard!

Getting Started
---------------

The best resource for getting started is the `xCDAT documentation website`_.
Our documentation provides general guidance for setting up xCDAT in an Anaconda
environment on your local `computer`_ or on an `HPC/Jupyter`_ environment. We also
include an `API Overview`_ and `Gallery`_ to highlight xCDAT functionality.

Features
--------

* Extension of xarray's ``open_dataset()`` and ``open_mfdataset()`` with post-processing options

  * Generate bounds for axes supported by ``xcdat`` if they don't exist in the Dataset
  * Optional selection of single data variable to keep in the Dataset (bounds are also
    kept if they exist)
  * Optional decoding of time coordinates

    * In addition to CF time units, also decodes common non-CF time units
      ("months since ...", "years since ...")

  * Optional centering of time coordinates using time bounds
  * Optional conversion of longitudinal axis orientation between [0, 360) and [-180, 180)

* Temporal averaging

  * Time series averages (single snapshot and grouped), climatologies, and departures
  * Weighted or unweighted
  * Optional seasonal configuration (e.g., DJF vs. JFD, custom seasons)

* Geospatial weighted averaging

  * Supports rectilinear grid
  * Optional specification of regional domain

* Horizontal structured regridding

  * Supports rectilinear and curvilinear grids
  * Extends the `xESMF`_ horizontal regridding API
  * Python implementation of  `regrid2`_ for handling cartesian latitude longitude grids

* Vertical structured regridding

  * Support rectilinear and curvilinear grids
  * Extends the `xgcm`_ vertical regridding API

Things We Are Striving For
--------------------------

* xCDAT supports CF compliant datasets, but will also strive to support datasets with
  common non-CF compliant metadata (e.g., time units in "months since ..." or "years
  since ...")

  * xCDAT leverages `cf_xarray`_ to interpret CF attributes on ``xarray`` objects
  * Refer to `CF Metadata Convention`_ for more information on CF attributes

* Robust handling of dimensions and their coordinates and coordinate bounds

  * Coordinate variables are retrieved with ``cf_xarray`` using CF axis names or
    coordinate names found in xarray object attributes. Refer to `Metadata Interpretation`_
    for more information.
  * Bounds are retrieved with ``cf_xarray`` using the ``"bounds"`` attr
  * Ability to operate on both longitudinal axis orientations, [0, 360) and [-180, 180)

* Support for parallelism using `dask`_ where it is both possible and makes sense

Releases
--------
xCDAT (released as ``xcdat``) follows a feedback-driven release cycle using continuous
integration/continuous deployment. Software releases are performed based on the bandwidth
of the development team, the needs of the community, and the priority of bug fixes or
feature updates.

After releases are performed on `GitHub Releases`_, the corresponding ``xcdat`` package
version will be available to download through Anaconda `conda-forge`_ usually within a day.

Projects Using xCDAT
--------------------

xCDAT is actively being integrated as a core component of the `Program for Climate Model
Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) Metrics Package`_ and the `Energy Exascale Earth
